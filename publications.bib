  abstract={Piloting requires users to control and navigate the aircraft within a designated pathway, with a controller that utilizes two joysticks to control the aircraft. This task is representative of various daily and gaming scenarios, such as controlling the aircraft to capture the photo or navigating an object in a game from the start position to the end via a trajectory. In this work, we explore a model (based on the Steering Law) that predicts the piloting time required in spatial-constrained environments. Thus, two user studies are conducted to help us understand the relationship between path complexity (curvature) and spatial constraints (width and height). According to the results, we propose a model that can achieve $52.6 \%$ and $60.6 \%$ improvement in R-square and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), respectively. Next, an additional study was conducted to further verify the performance and efficiency of our proposed model with the change of movement direction and orientation. Our model and experimental results can benefit both game and interface designers of applications that require controlling moving objects along specific trajectories in virtual reality environments.},

abstract = {Text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, yet developing an effective and user-friendly method remains a challenge. This paper introduces OnArmQWERTY, a text entry technique for AR HMDs that allows users to project a virtual QWERTY keyboard onto various locations on their non-dominant hand, including the palm, the back of the hand, and both the anterior and posterior sides of the forearm. Users interact with this overlaid keyboard on their skin by tapping with the index finger of the dominant hand, benefiting from the inherent self-haptic feedback of on-body interaction. A user study involving 13 participants evaluated the performance of OnArmQWERTY compared to a traditional mid-air virtual keyboard. The results demonstrate that OnArmQWERTY significantly improves typing speed and accuracy. Specifically, typing on the palm location outperforms all other on-arm locations, achieving a mean typing speed of 20.18 WPM and a mean error rate of 0.71\%, which underscores the importance of comfortable, ergonomic typing postures and effective tactile feedback as key factors enhancing text entry performance.},

abstract = {Virtual reality's (VR) unique affordances compared to traditional media have produced innovative interaction modes and tutorial methodologies in VR games. Existing research predominantly focuses on the performance of VR tutorial modes, such as the placement of text and diagrams within tutorial content. However, few studies have delved into other attributes of tutorials. This study categorizes 4 VR game tutorial modes based on time flow: (1) traditional instruction screen, (2) slow motion, (3) bullet time, and (4) context-sensitive mode. This paper evaluates the impact of these 4 VR game tutorial modes with varying time flow rates on controls learnability, engagement-related outcomes, and player performance. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 59 participants. Results indicated that bullet time significantly enhanced controls learnability, reduced cognitive load, and improved player performance when compared to other tutorial modes. Our research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of VR game tutorials and offers practical guidance for game designers, underscoring the potential of bullet time to enhance learnability and game experience.},
