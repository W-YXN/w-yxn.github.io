abstract: "Virtual reality's (VR) unique affordances compared to traditional media
  have produced innovative interaction modes and tutorial methodologies in VR games.
  Existing research predominantly focuses on the performance of VR tutorial modes,
  such as the placement of text and diagrams within tutorial content. However, few
  studies have delved into other attributes of tutorials. This study categorizes 4
  VR game tutorial modes based on time flow: (1) traditional instruction screen, (2)
  slow motion, (3) bullet time, and (4) context-sensitive mode. This paper evaluates
  the impact of these 4 VR game tutorial modes with varying time flow rates on controls
  learnability, engagement-related outcomes, and player performance. We conducted
  a between-subjects experiment with 59 participants. Results indicated that bullet
  time significantly enhanced controls learnability, reduced cognitive load, and improved
  player performance when compared to other tutorial modes. Our research contributes
  to a more comprehensive understanding of VR game tutorials and offers practical
  guidance for game designers, underscoring the potential of bullet time to enhance
  learnability and game experience."
