  abstract={Piloting requires users to control and navigate the aircraft within a designated pathway, with a controller that utilizes two joysticks to control the aircraft. This task is representative of various daily and gaming scenarios, such as controlling the aircraft to capture the photo or navigating an object in a game from the start position to the end via a trajectory. In this work, we explore a model (based on the Steering Law) that predicts the piloting time required in spatial-constrained environments. Thus, two user studies are conducted to help us understand the relationship between path complexity (curvature) and spatial constraints (width and height). According to the results, we propose a model that can achieve $52.6 \%$ and $60.6 \%$ improvement in R-square and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), respectively. Next, an additional study was conducted to further verify the performance and efficiency of our proposed model with the change of movement direction and orientation. Our model and experimental results can benefit both game and interface designers of applications that require controlling moving objects along specific trajectories in virtual reality environments.},
